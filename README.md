# Personal Comment
The entire development journey was fun yet challenging having want to make a really cool but simple design. Initially, the layout was super nested with about 600 lines in the xml. Memory loss stucked in and the scroll was super slow and shaky, so I eventually made everything simple. I realized the images also played a role.
